        Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their
        purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're
        also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest
        gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games
        that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When
        you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional
        costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial
        gift itself.Dave found joy in the daily routine of life. He awoke at the

        feeling she'd have for over five years of hard work?
