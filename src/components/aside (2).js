        It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action
        toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay
        or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once
        again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally
        find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first
        step.Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in
        the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in
        the atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary
        falling star. It seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles
        east of him.
